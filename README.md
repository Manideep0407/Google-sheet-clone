# Google Sheets Clone

[Live Demo](https://googlesheetclonemanideep.netlify.app/)

A web-based spreadsheet application that mimics core functionalities of Google Sheets, built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack & Data Structures

### Frontend Technologies
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.
- **Zustand**: For state management.
- **Immer**: For immutable state updates.
- **Lucide React**: For icons.

### Key Data Structures
- **Sheet Data Model**: Uses a flat object structure for cells with compound keys (row-col) for O(1) access.
  ```javascript
  {
    cells: {
      "0-0": Cell,
      "0-1": Cell,
      // ...
    }
  }
Cell Model: Contains properties like value, formula, computed value, dependencies, and format.
typescript
Copy code
interface Cell {
  id: string;
  value: string;
  formula: string;
  computedValue: string | number | null;
  dependencies: string[];
  format: CellFormat;
}
Formula Evaluation
Uses recursive descent parsing for formula evaluation.
Maintains a dependency graph for formula updates.
Prevents circular references.
Performance Optimizations
Virtual Rendering: Only renders visible cells.
Memoization: Prevents unnecessary re-renders using React.memo.
Efficient Updates: Uses Immer for immutable updates.
Features
Core Spreadsheet Features: Cell editing, formula support, range selection, column/row resizing.
Mathematical Functions: SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT.
Data Quality Functions: TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, FIND_AND_REPLACE.
Data Validation: Type checking, formula validation, error handling.
Why This Tech Stack?
React + TypeScript: Strong type safety and excellent developer experience.
Zustand: Lightweight and simple API for global state management.
Tailwind CSS: Fast development with a consistent design system.
Immer: Simplifies immutable state updates and reduces bugs.
Future Improvements
Performance: Implement WebWorkers for formula evaluation, and use IndexedDB for handling large datasets.
Features: Add more formula functions, undo/redo functionality, collaborative editing, and data visualization.
UI/UX: Add keyboard shortcuts, improve accessibility, and introduce more formatting options.
Data Persistence: Integrate cloud storage for data backup, implement auto-save, and provide export options.
Cloud Deployment & Security
Deployment
The application is deployed on Netlify for seamless continuous deployment and global access.
Security Controls
Data Security: Currently, the project does not handle sensitive data, but security measures like HTTPS and data encryption will be implemented in future updates.
Authentication: Plans for user authentication and role-based access control to ensure data privacy.
Input Validation: Strict validation to prevent malicious input and security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
