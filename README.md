Google Sheets Clone
Live Demo

A web-based spreadsheet application designed to mimic core functionalities of Google Sheets, built using React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies. This clone aims to provide users with the essential tools of a spreadsheet, including cell editing, formula support, data validation, and various mathematical and data quality functions.

## Tech Stack & Data Structures

### Frontend Technologies
- **React**: For building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Zustand**: For state management
- **Immer**: For immutable state updates
- **Lucide React**: For icons

### Key Data Structures

1. **Sheet Data Model**
   - Uses a flat object structure for cells with compound keys (`row-col`)
   - Enables O(1) access to any cell
   - Reduces memory usage compared to 2D arrays
   ```typescript
   {
     cells: {
       "0-0": Cell,
       "0-1": Cell,
       // ...
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Cell Model**
   ```typescript
   interface Cell {
     id: string;
     value: string;
     formula: string;
     computedValue: string | number | null;
     dependencies: string[];
     format: CellFormat;
   }
   ```

3. **Formula Evaluation**
   - Uses recursive descent parsing for formula evaluation
   - Maintains a dependency graph for formula updates
   - Prevents circular references

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Virtual Rendering**
   - Only renders visible cells
   - Improves performance with large datasets

2. **Memoization**
   - Uses React.memo for cell components
   - Prevents unnecessary re-renders

3. **Efficient Updates**
   - Uses Immer for immutable updates
   - Maintains referential equality for unchanged parts

4. **Change Detection**
   - Tracks cell dependencies
   - Only updates affected cells when formulas change

5.Cloud Deployment & Security
Deployment:
The application is deployed on Netlify, ensuring seamless continuous deployment and scaling. The platform allows fast global delivery, ensuring low-latency access to users across regions.

Security Controls:

Data Security: As of now, the project does not handle sensitive data; however, for production, measures like HTTPS, data encryption, and proper API authentication will be implemented.
Authentication: Future updates will include user authentication and role-based access control to protect user data and enhance privacy.
Input Validation: User inputs are strictly validated to avoid malicious entries or security breaches like SQL injection.
